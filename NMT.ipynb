It can be used to diagnose overfitting issues: if the training loss continues decreasing while the validation loss increases, this can mean that we are not doing enough regularization (e.g., `dropout`) or that the model is just too big for this tiny training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the training loss seems to stagnate, this can mean that we're doing too much regularization or not using the right learning rate schedule: the initial learning rate is either too large or too small, or a different scheduler should be used. By default, we're using ReduceLROnPlateau, which divides the learning rate by 10 when validation chrF hasn't improved (by at least a 0.5 margin) over the previous best. Depending on the model, this can be either too aggressive or not aggressive enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "`translate` lets you use the model to translate a single sentence (without having to preprocess it beforehand). Note that for simplicity, we do \"greedy\" decoding: we generate the highest-probability word at each step without seeking to maximize the sequence-level score. A slightly better and often used decoding algorithm is \"beam search\", which maintains a fixed number of hypotheses at each time step."

    "However, researchers observed that this type of RNN encoder/decoder model is hard to train and not very good to deal with long sequences, because the entire input has to be encoder into a single fixed-size vector, no matter its length. Because of this, attention mechanisms were introduced between the encoder and the decoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473): the decoder can look at different positions in the encoder depending on its own current state. This usually implemented as a weighted average over encoder states, whose weights are computed with a learnable feed-forward network taking an encoder state and a decoder state as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "But nowadays, the preferred architecture is the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) which uses a more complex \"multi-head attention\" mechanism, and not only between, but also within the encoder and the decoder (AKA \"self-attention\") as a replacement to the recursion of RNNs. Transformers are basically deep feed-forward networks where each layer has an attention mechanism over the preceding layer. Transformers are considerably faster to train than RNNs because all the states of a given layer can be computed in parallel."
